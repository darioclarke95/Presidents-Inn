REST API in Java using Jersey and JAX-RS

This is the source code from a project I did during my final year at undergrad.  We were tasked with creating a database and a REST API to manage the bookings of a fictitious Inn.


Most of the interesting stuff is in the /resources and /services folders. The /models folder is just where I created classes to structure data from requests and from the database (they're just classes with getters and setters).  I also used exceptions to simplyfy sending the correct HTTP responses (those other than 200).
